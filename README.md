XCOM-Mutators
=============

A project to create UT-like mutators for XCOM: EU/EW by Firaxis.

Since XCOM is Unreal Engine based, it has basic Unreal Mutators support. But XCOM is very different
from FPS games and basic Mutator class functions are not enough to handle XCOM modding tasks. This
project aims to create XComMutator class, which will allow to relatively easily write XCOM Mutators
using UDK. Since there is no built-in support for new class and its functions, "mutating" XCOM also
requires patching main packages (Engine, XComGame, XComStrategyGame) to insert Mutator calls in
appropriate places.
